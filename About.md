## 1. Where We Are Today (October 2025)

**Public experience**
- Reimagined homepage featuring hero spotlight carousel, featured stories, awardee highlights, vertical impact marquee, initiatives grid, FAQ accordion, partner CTA, and theme-aware styling.
- `/africa-future-leaders` route preserves the legacy landing experience for archive visitors.
- New `/initiatives/summit` deep-dive for the Future Leaders Summit with agenda, speakers, partner offerings, FAQ, and showcase CTA.
- Magazine hub refreshed at `/magazine` with dedicated copy, purchase flows for the 2024 digital & print editions, reader testimonials, and newsletter capture.
- Navigation updated with responsive header (mobile drawer with X toggle) and new “Top100 Africa Future Leaders” menu item.
- Footer now ships with a light/dark mode switch powered by `next-themes`.

**Key focus areas**
- Story-first marketing site that still reads well without live data thanks to curated mock content.
- Clear pathways into initiatives: Project100 Scholarship, Talk100 Live, Future Leaders Summit, Opportunities Hub.
- Consistent CTA language around “Register Interest”, “Become a Partner”, “Volunteer”, and “Apply to Showcase”.
- Theme support (light & dark) applied globally via CSS variables and Tailwind utilities.

## 5. Data Architecture

- **Database:** Supabase Postgres (schema managed in `supabase/schema.sql`).
- **Core tables:**
  - `profiles` — canonical user record with role (`user` / `admin`), social links, and metadata.
  - `awardees` — curated awardee entries linked to profiles; triggers keep slugs in sync.
  - `events` — public program events with schedules, locations, registration CTAs, JSON metadata.
  - `user_notifications` — queued dashboard alerts.
- **RLS:** Enabled across tables. Public read access is limited to published fields; writes require service role keys.
- **Triggers:** Maintain `updated_at`, generate slugs, and sync awardee/profile updates.
- **Realtime:** Publications configured for `awardees`, `events`, etc., allowing live updates in admin/dashboard.

---

## 6. Authentication & Authorization

- **Better Auth** via `/api/better-auth`:
  - Email/password flow with Next.js cookies using `nextCookies`.
  - Persists user roles (defaults to `user`, can be elevated in Supabase).
  - Client wrapper in `lib/better-auth/client.ts` simplifies protected API calls.
- Role gating: Admin-only routes and dashboards rely on Supabase profile role checks.

- Landing metrics widget, quick actions for awardee/blog/event creation.
- Reusable form patterns with `react-hook-form` + `zod`.
- Realtime updates on awardees and events.
- Future work: granular role-based UI (editors vs. super admins) and richer analytics.

---

## 9. Supabase & API Utilities

- `lib/supabase/client.ts` — browser client; realtime tuned for moderate event volumes.
- `lib/supabase/server.ts` — server client with optional service-role flag.
- `lib/api/` utilities standardize error handling and response patterns.
- Data import/export scripts rely on Excel templates for awardee seed data.

---

## 10. Testing & QA

- Current: manual QA across marketing pages and admin flows.
- Planned:
  - Extend ESLint coverage and enforce pre-commit formatting.
  - Add Playwright smoke tests for sign-in, awardee publish, and event creation.
  - Seed Supabase fixtures for preview deployments.

---

## 11. Deployment Checklist

1. Provision environment variables in Vercel (or chosen platform).
2. Run Supabase migrations (`supabase/schema.sql`) or apply equivalent SQL migrations.
3. Set `BETTER_AUTH_URL` to the production domain for email flows.
4. Harden security: never expose `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` client-side.
5. Configure storage bucket (`awardees`) for media uploads if not already present.

---

## 12. Roadmap Highlights

- Build Talk100 Live standalone initiative page.
- Enrich Opportunities Hub with dynamic filters and submission forms.
- Integrate analytics dashboard into the admin home.
- Automate role promotion tooling for Better Auth users.
- Expand light/dark mode support across all inner routes (admin, blog detail, etc.).
- Add localized experiences (multi-language copy toggles).

---

## 13. Quick Reference

- **Primary datastore:** Supabase `public` schema.
- **Auth gate:** Better Auth + Supabase profile roles.
- **Realtime footprint:** Awardees, events, and future expansions.
- **Marketing alignment:** All marketing pages consume the same datasets the admin team curates—changes propagate instantly.
- **Theme readiness:** Light & dark palettes already wired; new components should stick to `bg-*` and `text-*` classes derived from CSS variables.
